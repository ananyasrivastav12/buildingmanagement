## Stories


The first screen or the homepage of the web application, contains the name, slogan, and an illustration to catch the user's eye.

There is a prompt which suggests the user to scroll down so they can log into their account or create a new one.

Once a user completes the login, they are taken to a new page where they can choose to either add a room, or book a room.

    Scenario 1: The user wishes to book or cancel a reservation

    The user is guided to a new screen where they can access the interactive calender to pick any date of their choice.
    Once they click on a date, they are guided to a new page where they can see all the rooms and their availibilities, capacities, etc for the selected date.

        Scenario 1a:
        If they wish to reserve a room, they can select on an available room, and the wbsite takes them to a new page where they can edit or confirm their booking details.

        Once they confirm, they are guided to a confimation page where all their details are shown. 

        The user then recieves an option to either reserve another room, or to log out. 

        Scenario 1b:
        If they wish to cancel an existing reservation, they can select on an available room, and if they have an existing reservation,  the wbsite takes them to a new page where they can confirm their booking details.

        Once they confirm, they are guided to a confimation page where their cancellation is confirmed and all their details are shown. 

        The user then recieves an option to either reserve another room, or to log out. 

    Scenario 2: The user wishes to add room details

        The user is guided to a new screen where they can access the interactive calender to pick any date of their choice.

        Once they click on a date, they are guided to a new page where they can type in the details for the room including their room number, capacities, etc.

        Once they press confirm, the room details get added to the database, and the user is guided to the confirmation page.


At every page of the website, the user has a way to go to the last page, or to log out.
